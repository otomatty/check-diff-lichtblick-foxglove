# monaco-editor-example

This is a simple [Lichtblick](https://github.com/Lichtblick-Suite) extension panel that demonstrates
embedding the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) in a custom panel.

Note that this uses the [Monaco React](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react) wrapper which
relies on a CDN distribution of the Monaco editor so it will not work offline.
